# FLIGHT STATUS NOTIFICATION

A simple application to send notification to subscribed users of updated flight details on their gmail.

I have a created a simple page where all flight details are shown and we can either edit or subscribe to a flight.

* Subscribing to a flight will add the user to subscribe list corresponding to that flight in the firebase store.

* On editing a flight details mimicking an flight webshook response will send a mail to all the user who have subscribed to that flight.
